So 7 is the combination of permissions 4+2+1 (read, write, and execute), 5 is 4+0+1 (read, no write, and execute), and 4 is 4+0+0 (read, no write, and no execute).",

This is not a fussy thing is you only do it in a low frequency. But when you need to do it in a high frequency, it certainly becomes fussy. With the help of IntelliJ IDEA, things can be much simpler. When you want to upload some files, you don't need to leave your editor (IDE), you just stay on it and right click your mouse on the target file or folder, and you will find target menu like \"upload to xxx.xx.xx.xxx\".",

If there is another person walking together, and if silence is impolite due to disacquaintance, meaning that I should do some talking other than only walking, then walking of this kind is boring for boring person like me. However, if there are more than two persons in total, e.g. 3 persons, then I can keep silent or talk when I want to talk, resulting in everything comfortable.",

My friends told me that if a girl shield you from her wechat moment, she may at first lack some sense with you. So for me, a talking-less man, it's better to stop wasting time on her. You know, if you want to play with small probability, you will likely to feel tired, and this feeling is in most case meaningless. The girl you doesn't need to pursuit is the right girl you should pursuit. And the girl you should pursuit is likely to be the wrong girl that you should not pursuit.",

She was not as tall and as beautiful as the schoolmate of my little sister, but the feeling with her was so good! She is 1.61 m high, and also very beautiful. We both worked in Shanghai City for the time being. I had gone to Shuangshuang's home for twice, and it seemed that Shuangshuang's parents liked me in generally. The second time I went to Shuangshuang's home, while drinking with her father, I happened to see Shuangshuang pouting her lips coquettishly to her mother, seeing which I felt my heart thawed out.",
